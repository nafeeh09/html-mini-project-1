        Kireedam (transl. Crown) is a 1989 Indian Malayalam-language action drama film directed by Sibi Malayil and written by A. K. Lohithadas. The film stars Mohanlal, Thilakan, and Parvathy Jayaram, along with Kaviyoor Ponnamma, Mohan Raj, Murali, Sreenath, Kundara Johny, Cochin Haneefa, Jagathy Sreekumar, Philomina, Usha, Jagadish, Maniyanpilla Raju, Mamukkoya, Oduvil Unnikrishnan, and Kanakalatha in supporting roles. The music for the film was composed by Johnson.

The film is about a youth, Sethumadhavan (Mohanlal), whose hopes and aspirations are shattered by a combination of fate and human falling. It explores how society type-casts individuals and forces them to act that part whether they like it or not. Mohanlal won the National Film Award – Special Mention "for portraying young man's agony and pain marvellously and in unique style". Lohithadas won the Kerala Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay. The title 'Kireedam' refers to the metaphorical crown that the villagers of Ramapuram bestows upon Sethumadhavan after he kills Keerikadan Jose.

Kireedam was released on 7 July 1989. It was a major commercial success at the box office. It received widespread critical acclaim and praise for the performances of Mohanlal and Thilakan, the screenplay, and the soundtrack. It is regarded as one of the classics in Indian cinema. A sequel to the film titled Chenkol was released in 1993. Kireedam was remade into six other languages — in Telugu as Rowdyism Nasinchali (1990), in Kannada as Modada Mareyalli (1991), in Hindi as Gardish (1993), in Bengali Bangladesh as Babar Adesh (1995), in Bengali as Nayak-The Real Hero (2005) and in Tamil as Kireedam (2007) - becoming Mohanlal's first movie to be remade in six other languages. In 2007, it became the third Indian movie to be remade in six other languages after Poovinu Puthiya Poonthennal and Anuraga Aralithu.
