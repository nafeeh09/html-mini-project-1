The film deals with political activism existing in Kerala and takes major digs on the political parties in the state. In the film, Raghavan, a retired railway employee, wishes to live the rest of his life with his family. However, he is forced to become a mediator and reconcile his two sons who feud over petty politics.

A commercial success upon release, Sandesam is often regarded as a classic in Malayalam cinema.[1] The film was included in IBN Live's list of "100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time".[2][3][4] The film was remade in Tamil language as Veettai Paar Naattai Paar by director Thulasidas in 1994.
