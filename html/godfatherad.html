        Godfather is a 1991 Indian Malayalam-language action comedy drama film written and directed by Siddiqueâ€“Lal. It is produced by Appachan under the banner of Swargachithra. The film stars N. N. Pillai,Mukesh,Thilakan, Innocent and Bheeman Raghu with Philomina, Kanaka, Jagadish, Siddique and K. P. A. C. Lalitha in supporting roles.[2] The film revolves around the rivalry between two families, the Anjooran and Anappara houses and the consequences faced when two members of the families fall in love.[3][4]

Godfather was initially planned to be released before In Harihar Nagar (1990), however Siddique-Lal felt that the film's script was not complete, and as a result stretched production time.[5] The film was released on 15 November 1991 to positive reviews and became a blockbuster, running for 404 days.[6] The film was the second highest grosser of the year, only behind by Kilukkam.[6] It was later remade in Telugu as Peddarikam, in Marathi as Ghayaal, in Hindi as Hulchul, in Kannada as Pandavaru, and in Odia as Love Dot Com.[7] The movie was shot entirely in Kozhikode.
