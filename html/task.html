    <h2>Israel tells people in Lebanon to move from Hezbollah targets as 'extensive' strikes begin</h2>
    <p>The Israeli military says it is conducting "extensive" air strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon as cross-border attacks between the two sides continue to ratchet up

        A spokesperson for the military, Daniel Hagari, has warned Lebanese civilians to move away from areas used by the Iran-backed group for military purposes
        
        At the weekend, Hezbollah struck deep inside Israel, reaching targets in the city of Haifa
        
        On Sunday, its deputy leader said it was now in an open-ended battle of reckoning with Israel
        
        It comes as President Joe Biden has said the US will do everything in its power to prevent an escalation of the conflict</p>
