<h2>Trump says he will not run again if he loses election</h2>
<p>Former President Donald Trump has said he does not expect to run for election again in 2028 if he is defeated in this November's US presidential poll.
    Trump, 78, has been the Republican candidate for three national elections in a row and has reshaped the party greatly over the last eight years.
    In an interview with Sinclair Media Group, he was asked if he could foresee another run in the event that he loses to Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris. "No, I don't. I think... that will be it," Trump said. "I don't see that at all."
    But he added that "hopefully, we're going to be very successful".</p>
