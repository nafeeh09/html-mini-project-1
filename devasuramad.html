        Devaasuram (transl. Of Gods and Demons) is a 1993 Indian Malayalam-language action drama film directed by I. V. Sasi and written by Ranjith. It stars Mohanlal, Revathi, and Napoleon, with Innocent, V. K. Sreeraman, Maniyanpilla Raju, and Augustine in supporting roles. The songs featured in the film were composed by M. G. Radhakrishnan, while S. P. Venkatesh composed the background score. It was Mohanlal's 200th film.

The film depicts the rivalry between two spoiled heirs of two feudal families—Mangalassery Neelakandan (Mohanlal) and Mundakkal Shekaran (Napoleon). The character Neelakandan was created by Ranjith based on a real-life person named Mullasserry Rajagopal (died 2002).[2] The film was shot at Varikkasseri Mana in Ottappalam.

Devaasuram was a critical and commercially successful movie. It is considered to be a classic and the character of Mangalassery Neelakandan is considered as one of the best roles of Mohanlal.[3] It was followed by a sequel, Ravanaprabhu (2001), which was writer Ranjith's directorial debut. The film was remade in Telugu the same year as Kunti Putrudu.[4]
